	TMEA is implementing an online contracts management portal. The online portal is meant to provide a platform for suppliers and consultants to register as vendors. This is a first-rate launch-pad to introduce your goods and services to TMEA in all the East African Countries. The portal also acts as a critical procurement tool in shortlisting of suppliers in competitive bidding. Therefore TMEA will from time to time advertise for procurement opportunities on this portal. Interested firms and individuals are encouraged to apply online.</div>

	The portal makes it easy for you to submit your application. Once you are registered and become part of our supplier database, then you can easily take advantage of future tender opportunities at TMEA. We encourage individuals and firms who would like to register online to sufficiently prepare and complete the online application form. This is to enable us to proficiently process your application.</div>
